# TeliDermAI: AI-Powered Skin Disease Diagnosis & Chatbot

## 📌 Project Overview
TeliDermAI is an AI-powered solution designed to assist in early skin disease detection using deep learning and AI-driven chatbot support. It integrates state-of-the-art machine learning models with an intuitive user interface to make dermatological diagnostics more accessible. 

This project is part of the **Google Developer Groups (GDG) Challenge**, aimed at leveraging AI for impactful healthcare solutions. The system supports medical professionals and individuals by providing real-time skin condition analysis and intelligent medical query resolution. 

## 📌 Problem Statement
Skin diseases are among the most common health concerns worldwide, yet access to dermatologists remains limited, particularly in remote areas. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment, but many individuals delay seeking medical attention due to lack of awareness or accessibility to specialists.

### 📌 Solution Approach
TeliDermAI addresses this issue by:
- **AI-Based Skin Disease Classification**: Uses pre-trained deep learning models (ResNet50 & EfficientNetB0) to identify 23 different skin diseases from uploaded images.
- **Intelligent Chatbot for Medical Queries**: Powered by Google Gemini AI, enabling users to obtain instant, accurate responses to dermatology-related questions.
- **Medical Document Querying**: Allows healthcare professionals to upload and search through medical PDFs for relevant insights using FAISS-based vector search.
- **User-Friendly Web Interface**: Developed using Streamlit, making it easy for users to interact with the system.
- **Scalability and Remote Accessibility**: Cloud-based deployment ensures the solution can be accessed anytime, anywhere.

## 📌 Key Features
✔ **Real-Time Skin Disease Detection** with high-accuracy AI models  
✔ **Conversational AI Chatbot** for instant medical insights  
✔ **PDF-Based Information Retrieval** for professionals  
✔ **Fast & Secure Data Processing** using optimized AI models  
✔ **Easy-to-Use Web Application** with an intuitive interface  
✔ **Supports Remote Diagnosis** and accessibility in underserved regions  

## 📌 How It Works
1️⃣ **User uploads an image of a skin condition**  
2️⃣ **AI classifies the disease and provides diagnosis insights**  
3️⃣ **User can ask medical questions via chatbot**  
4️⃣ **Medical professionals can upload and search PDFs for dermatology-related content**

## 📌 Future Enhancements
 **Mobile App Integration** for real-time diagnostics  
 **Multilingual Support** for a wider reach  
 **Telemedicine Integration** with direct dermatologist consultations  
 **Enhanced AI Transparency & Explainability** for user trust  
 **Data Analytics Dashboard** for medical research and insights  

## 📌 Why This Project Stands Out
- **Developed for the GDG Challenge**, focusing on AI’s role in solving real-world healthcare challenges.
- **Uses Google Gemini AI** for advanced natural language understanding.
- **Supports IDX Platform** for seamless deployment and additional scoring benefits in the competition.
- **Combines AI & Healthcare Innovation** to improve early disease detection and accessibility.
